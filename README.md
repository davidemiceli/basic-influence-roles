_**A deterministic scalable algorithm to detect and measure the basic influence role each node plays within a directed network.**_

Every node plays a certain role in the network and affects the other nodes in its own different way.
Given a large dataset of nodes as input, the algorithm provides:
- A ranking of all nodes by influence score
- The typology of influence, the basic influence role
- The influence measure based on influence role
- The level (the role's subcategory based on influence measure)
- An influence score based on generic indegree and outdegree

The algorithm is implemented in the following programming languages:
- [**Python**](/python)
- [**JavaScript**](/javascript)

## Basic Influence Roles (BIRs)

We have six basic influence roles summarized below.

</p>

Role | Description | Levels
--- | --- | --- |
`Emitter` | A node that spreads information without receiving. | `branch`, `weak`, `strong`, `top`
`Amplifier` | A node with significantly more outgoing connections than incoming ones. | `weak`, `strong`, `top`
`Hub` | A node balanced as production and reception of information. | `branch`, `weak`, `strong`, `top`
`Reducer` | A node with significantly more incoming connections than outcoming ones | `weak`, `strong`, `top`
`Receiver` | A node which receives only interactions, but does not produce any. | `branch`, `weak`, `strong`, `top`
`Isolated` | A totally non-participatory (or totally disconnected) node | `none`

## BIRs' Levels

The levels of BIRs are subcategories based on the influence magnitude of every role. Below we have the description of every level and a graph representation of the branch nodes.

Level | Description
--- | --- |
`None` | A total absence of influence.
`Branch` | The lowest influence related to a given role.
`Weak` | A weak role influence.
`Strong` | A strong role influence.
`Top` | The greatest influence related to a given role.

## BIRs' Influence Measure

Influence measure is a normalized value to quantify the magnitude of influence for each role.

## Research Notebooks

For reliability aims, we provide two research notebooks, that can be also useful as examples, under the folder [`/research-notebooks`](/research-notebooks), to test the algorithm behavior across both static and dynamic network structures using synthetic datasets.
